# Java Console Projects: ATM Interface & Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This repository contains two Java console applications designed to practice fundamental programming concepts:

1. **ATM Interface**  
   A simple banking simulation that lets users deposit, withdraw, transfer money, and view transaction history. Users enter any username and a 4-digit PIN to access the menu.

2. **Number Guessing Game**  
   A fun interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts. The program provides hints if the guess is too high or low and calculates a score based on the number of tries.
